# Apnea Respiration Control (ARC)
The ARC is a device intended to monitor and prevent obstructive sleep apnea that uses an accelerometer to measure respiration amplitude. On the precipice of an apneic event, the device transmits a stimulation pulse through a conductive cuff wrapped around the user's hypoglossal nerve and eases the user into normal breathing.

**Platform: Microchip PIC**
Testing Apparatus: Animal respirator and Arduino Uno

ApneaRespirationControl-Software: Contains the code to control an Obstructive Sleep Apnea monitoring device

ArduinoDataCapture: (Used for testing the device) An Arduino sketch deployed to capture real-time measurements from the ARC. Used in testing to verify that measurements acquired by the PIC microcontroller are correct.
