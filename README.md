# ApneaRespirationControl (ARC)
The ARC is a device intended to monitor and prevent obstructive sleep apnea that uses an accelerometer to measure respiration amplitude. On the precipice of an apneic event,
the device transmits a stimulation pulse through a conductive cuff wrapped around the user's hypoglossal nerve and eases the user into normal breathing.

ApneaRespirationControl-Software: Contains the code to control an Obstructive Sleep Apnea monitoring device
ArduinoDataCapture: An Arduino sketch deployed to capture real-time measurements from the ARC
